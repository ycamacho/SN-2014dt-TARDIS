# SN-2014dt-TARDIS

The input and output files used to model the spectra of Supernova 2014dt using the radiative transfer code TARDIS in Camacho-Neves et al. 2023.

Each input file has a corresponding output file with a nearly identical name. 

The input files (TARDIS input file) are in the folder input_yml_files and are named as "UT-date_phase_telescope_model.yml".

The output files (synthetic spectra) are in the folder output_synthetic_spectra and are named as "UT-date_phase_telescope_model_spec.dat". Each output file is a two-column text file with wavelength (Angstrom) and luminosity (erg/s/Angstrom).
